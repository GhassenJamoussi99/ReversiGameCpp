## Introduction
This project is an implementation of the classic game Reversi in C++. This repository contains the source code and other files necessary to build the program.

## Development Environment
This development environment consists of the following files and folders:

* `data` - contains various data files which are accessed by the game.
* `external` - contains external libraries used by the game.
* `include` - contains the header files for the game.
* `src` - contains the source code for the game.
* `tests` - contains the different types of tests for the game.
* `Makefile` - contains the build instructions for the game.
* `run_cppcheck.sh` - contains a script for running cppcheck.
* `sources.mk` - contains a list of files to be compiled.

## Usage
To compile the program, run the following command in the root directory of the project:
```
make
```

This will compile the project and generate an executable file called `reversi_game` under `ReversiGame/`. To run the program, execute the following command:

```
./reversi_game
```
